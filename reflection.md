## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

This project aims to build a real-time air quality dashboard accessible through a web browser using Streamlit. At its core, it functions by retrieving air quality data from the Open-Meteo API for a user-specified location (currently defaulting to Brock Hall, Maryland). This retrieval process is handled by the api_extraction.py module, which fetches the raw data in JSON format and then saves it locally in a cache directory as air_quality_data.json. This caching mechanism is implemented to avoid repeated calls to the API, especially during development and testing. The next stage involves the data_transformation.py module, which is responsible for reading this cached JSON data using the Pandas library and transforming it into a structured DataFrame that is easier to work with for visualization. This transformation typically involves reshaping the data to have columns for time, pollutant type, and pollutant value. Finally, the visualization.py module takes this transformed DataFrame and uses the Plotly Express library to generate interactive line charts showing the trends of different air pollutants over time. These charts are then displayed within the Streamlit application (app.py), providing users with a visual representation of the air quality data for their chosen location. The Streamlit interface allows users to input latitude and longitude, triggering the data fetching and updating process, thus creating a dynamic and potentially real-time view of air quality information.

This project has been a significant learning experience. Initially, I jumped into using the forecast API endpoint with the assumption that it would serve the air quality data I needed. This proved to be incorrect, leading to the persistent "Failed to fetch air quality data" error. This taught me a valuable lesson about the importance of precision when working with APIs, specifically the necessity of identifying and using the correct endpoint for the desired data. My assumption, based on the general provider, was not sufficient, and I learned that carefully consulting API documentation is a crucial first step that I should prioritize in future projects.

The debugging process, particularly the implementation of more detailed logging within the fetch_air_quality_data function, was incredibly insightful. By adding print statements to track the API request URL, parameters, response status code, and the initial part of the response content, I was able to move beyond the generic error message in the Streamlit app and gain a clearer understanding of where the process was failing. This experience underscored the power of logging as a diagnostic tool, especially when dealing with external systems like web APIs.

Discovering the dedicated air quality API endpoint (https://air-quality-api.open-meteo.com/v1/air-quality) was a breakthrough. It highlighted that even within a single API provider, different types of data are often served through distinct URLs, each with its own specific requirements and response structures. This realization reinforced the need to thoroughly explore API documentation to pinpoint the exact resources I need.

While I successfully resolved the data fetching issue, I still have some lingering questions. I'm curious about the precise technical reasons why the forecast API rejected my air quality parameter requests with the "Data corrupted..." error. Understanding the underlying architecture and limitations of different API endpoints would be beneficial. Furthermore, now that I'm receiving data from the correct air quality API, I need to delve into the specifics of its JSON response structure to effectively transform and visualize it.

My primary struggle in this phase was the initial misdirection in choosing the API endpoint. I relied too heavily on a general understanding of the API provider rather than conducting a targeted search for the air quality-specific documentation and URL. This emphasizes an area where I need to improve: my ability to efficiently and accurately navigate API documentation to find the precise information required. I also recognize that I could enhance my error handling to provide more specific feedback to the user based on different API response codes or potential network issues.

Moving forward, my immediate next steps are to locate and meticulously review the documentation for the Open-Meteo Air Quality API. This will involve understanding the structure of the JSON data, the available pollutants and their units, and any specific instructions for making requests. Following this, I will need to adapt the load_data_from_cache and transform_air_quality_data functions to correctly process this new data structure using Pandas. Finally, I will update the visualization.py file to generate meaningful charts based on the transformed data and display them in the Streamlit application. This iterative process of fetching, examining, transforming, and visualizing will be crucial for completing the project successfully and solidifying my understanding of data pipelines and API interactions.
